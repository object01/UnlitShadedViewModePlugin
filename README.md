# ToolArcade Unlit Shaded View Mode
## What is it?
Adds a new "Unlit Shaded" view mode that improves on Unreal's built-in Unlit view mode by adding definition to shapes and surfaces in an otherwise unlit view.

Thanks to https://bsky.app/profile/joewintergreen.com for the idea and the original implementation.

## How do I use it?
Find the new "Unlit Shaded" view mode in the "Buffer Visualization" submenu, in the viewport's "View Mode" menu.
